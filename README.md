# Rubies

Newcomers to programming would benefit from practicing drills regularly until basic problem solving becomes second nature. This gem is a command line tool that allows users to solve randomly generated small problems. It currently supports drills surrounding complex data structures.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rubies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rubies

## Usage

I'm currently working on getting this to run from the command line. For now, you can install the right dependencies: 'faker', 'colorize', 'awesome_print'. Then . . .

```
pry
[1] pry(main)> require 'rubies'
```

Then the gem runs.
